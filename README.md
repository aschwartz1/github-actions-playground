### A repository for me to learn about GitHub Actions.

Going to start by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart).

Further thoughts on what to try:
- [ ] Create a rails app (aka make this repo for a rails app) and follow [this guide](https://medium.com/@OwenTran/github-workflow-for-rails-ci-34209a53d19e) for running model tests
- [ ] Setup some actions for pull requests like...
  - [ ] If PR is a draft, add the "draft" label
  - [ ] If PR is marked ready for review, remove the "draft" label
- [ ] Add docker, and git actions working w/ it
